### This is an Gemini 2 duplicate 
You can use this project just by adding the API_KEY ="Your_API_KEY" in gemini.js file

you can get your own Google Gemini API Key from the Goodle developers Website

Well I am still working on this adding the night mode, and other options and features if possible
You can also do the gemini 2.5 and other versions integration but they are paid so be mindfull of it.

Its not recommended to directly upload the API key in the file rather you should create the .env file in the root folder / server folder
for security purpose
